# This is configuration file for network simulator 
# You can provide following parameters:
#
# 	SuccessRatio - probability of successful propagation of data
# 	I_max - maximum current consumption
#	V_max - maximum voltage
# 	V_min - minimum voltage
#	C_bat - capacity of battery 
#   Ts 	  - time slice length
#   Tsync - length of monotonic interval
#   mdist - radio distance 

# [0, 1] - probability 
SuccessRatio = 1.0

# Current in mA 
I_max = 20.0

# Voltage in V
V_max = 3.3 
V_min = 1.8

# Time in ms 
Ts = 3000.0
Tsync = 10000.0

# C_bat in mAh
C_bat = 4000.0

# mdist
mdist = 1.41421
